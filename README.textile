h1. Bort

This is a fork of a fork of the Bort project that I've tailored a bit to my personal liking. It supports Rails 2.3.2 and includes cucumber, rspec 1.2.8, webrat, and haml. However, I haven't yet converted the original bort stories to cucumber features.

Bort is a base Rails 2.3 application that makes creating new projects easier and faster.
